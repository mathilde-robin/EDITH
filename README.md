#### 🎯 **Motivations**

The `EDITH` package enables the synergistic effects of two or three drugs to be explored,
based on cell viability data obtained from combination experiments. 

#### ⚙️ **Installation**

```r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("devtools")
}

if (!requireNamespace("ComplexHeatmap", quietly = TRUE)) {
    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
        install.packages("BiocManager")
    }
    BiocManager::install("ComplexHeatmap")
}

devtools::install_github("mathilde-robin/EDITH")
```

#### 📊 **Input for `EDITH`**

EDITH can explore the synergistic effects of two or three drugs based on cell 
viability data obtained from combination experiments. The input data should be
provided in a specific format, as described in the package documentation. 
Example datasets are included in the package to illustrate the required format
(`inst/extdata/2drugs.xlsx` and `inst/extdata/3drugs.xlsx`).

Here a snapshot of the input data format for two drugs:

#### 🚀 **Usage**

`EDITH` is a all-in-one function that performs the entire analysis pipeline, 
from data preprocessing to visualization of results. The `run_EDITH()` function
detects whether the input data corresponds to a two-drug or three-drug combination
and applies the appropriate analysis methods accordingly. The input file path is
specified via a pop-up window when the function is executed.

```r
library(EDITH)
run_EDITH()
``` 

#### 🎉 **Output**

The main outputs of the `EDITH` package include:

- Heatmaps visualizing the viability data across different drug concentration combinations,
- Heatmaps visualizing the expected viability based on the Bliss independence model,
- Heatmaps visualizing the interaction effect,
- Summary tables detailing the additive, combination and efficacy indexes.

Here are example heatmaps generated by `EDITH` for two-drug combinations:
