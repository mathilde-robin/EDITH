# **EDITH** - Evaluation of Drug Interactions in the setting of THerapy combinations <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="150"/>

<br>

## 🔗 **Reference**

🔎 The full package documentation is available here: https://mathilde-robin.github.io/EDITH/.

🌱 The initial development of this package was motivated by the work of 
[Tosi et al., BMC Cancer, 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12885-018-4712-z).

## 🎯 **Motivations**

Characterizing interactions between drugs is an area of major interest for drug  
development, as exploiting synergism between drugs could allow increasing  treatment 
efficacy using lower doses of single drugs, and avoiding antagonistic  interaction 
is needed to maintain the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. Broadly speaking,
synergism and antagonism could be defined as an increase or a reduction of the
effect of a drug combination compared to the effect expected for the combination 
on  the basis of the single agent effects.

The `EDITH` package enables the synergistic effects of two or three drugs to be explored,
based on cell viability data obtained from combination experiments. The package 
is designed to analyze and visualize drug interactions and implements a widely 
used method for assessing drug interactions: *the Bliss independence model*.

## ⚙️ **Installation**

```r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("devtools")
}

if (!requireNamespace("ComplexHeatmap", quietly = TRUE)) {
    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
        install.packages("BiocManager")
    }
    BiocManager::install("ComplexHeatmap")
}

devtools::install_github("mathilde-robin/EDITH")
```

## 📊 **Input for `EDITH`**

EDITH can explore the synergistic effects of two or three drugs based on cell 
viability data obtained from combination experiments. The input data should be
provided in a specific format, as described in the package documentation. 
Example datasets are included in the package to illustrate the required format
(`inst/extdata/2drugs.xlsx` and `inst/extdata/3drugs.xlsx`) and can be found with 
this command: 

```r
list.files(path = system.file("extdata", package = "EDITH"), full.names = TRUE)
``` 

Here a snapshot of the input data format (in a excel file) for two drugs:

- for three drugs: https://mathilde-robin.github.io/EDITH/articles/three_drugs.html

## 🚀 **Usage**

`run_EDITH()` is a all-in-one function that performs the entire analysis pipeline, 
from data preprocessing to visualization of results. The `run_EDITH()` function
detects whether the input data corresponds to a two-drug or three-drug combination
and applies the appropriate analysis methods accordingly. The input file path is
specified via a pop-up window when the function is executed.

```r
library(EDITH)
run_EDITH()
```

## 🎉 **Output**

The main outputs of the `EDITH` package include:

- Heatmaps visualizing the viability data across different drug concentration combinations,
- Heatmaps visualizing the expected viability based on the Bliss independence model,
- Heatmaps visualizing the interaction effect,
- Summary tables detailing the additive, combination and efficacy indexes.

Here are example heatmaps generated by `EDITH` for two-drug combinations:
