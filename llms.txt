# **EDITH** - Evaluation of Drug Interactions in the setting of THerapy combinations

  

## 🔗 **Reference**

🔎 The full package documentation is available here:
<https://mathilde-robin.github.io/EDITH/>.

🌱 The initial development of this package was motivated by the work of
[Tosi et al., BMC Cancer,
2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12885-018-4712-z).

  

## 🎯 **Motivations**

Characterizing interactions between drugs is an area of major interest
for drug  
development, as exploiting synergism between drugs could allow
increasing treatment efficacy using lower doses of single drugs, and
avoiding antagonistic interaction is needed to maintain the therapeutic
efficacy of drugs. Broadly speaking, synergism and antagonism could be
defined as an increase or a reduction of the effect of a drug
combination compared to the effect expected for the combination on the
basis of the single agent effects.

The `EDITH` package enables the synergistic effects of two or three
drugs to be explored, based on cell viability data obtained from
combination experiments. The package is designed to analyze and
visualize drug interactions and implements a widely used method for
assessing drug interactions: *the Bliss independence model*.

  

## ⚙️ **Installation**

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("remotes")
}

if (!requireNamespace("ComplexHeatmap", quietly = TRUE)) {
    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
        install.packages("BiocManager")
    }
    BiocManager::install("ComplexHeatmap")
}

remotes::install_github("mathilde-robin/EDITH")
```

## 📊 **Input for `EDITH`**

EDITH can explore the synergistic effects of two or three drugs based on
cell viability data obtained from combination experiments. The input
data should be provided in a specific format, as described in the
package documentation. Example datasets are included in the package to
illustrate the required format (`inst/extdata/2drugs.xlsx` and
`inst/extdata/3drugs.xlsx`) and can be found with this command:

``` r
list.files(path = system.file("extdata", package = "EDITH"), full.names = TRUE)
```

Here a snapshot of the input data format (in a excel file) for two
drugs:

- for two drugs:

- for three drugs:
  <https://mathilde-robin.github.io/EDITH/articles/three_drugs.html>

  

## 🚀 **Usage**

[`run_EDITH()`](reference/run_EDITH.md) is a all-in-one function that
performs the entire analysis pipeline, from data preprocessing to
visualization of results. The [`run_EDITH()`](reference/run_EDITH.md)
function detects whether the input data corresponds to a two-drug or
three-drug combination and applies the appropriate analysis methods
accordingly. The input file path is specified via a pop-up window when
the function is executed.

``` r
library(EDITH)
run_EDITH()
```

  

## 🎉 **Output**

The main outputs of the `EDITH` package include:

- Heatmaps visualizing the viability data across different drug
  concentration combinations,
- Heatmaps visualizing the expected viability based on the Bliss
  independence model,
- Heatmaps visualizing the interaction effect,
- Summary tables detailing the additive, combination and efficacy
  indexes.

Here are example heatmaps generated by `EDITH` for two-drug
combinations:
