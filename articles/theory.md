## 🎯 **Aim**

Characterizing interactions between drugs is an area of major interest
for drug  
development, as exploiting synergism between drugs could allow
increasing treatment efficacy using lower doses of single drugs, and
avoiding antagonistic interaction is needed to maintain the therapeutic
efficacy of drugs. Broadly speaking, synergism and antagonism could be
defined as an increase or a reduction of the effect of a drug
combination compared to the effect expected for the combination on the
basis of the single agent effects.

The `EDITH` package enables the synergistic effects of two or three
drugs to be explored, based on cell viability data obtained from
combination experiments. The package is designed to analyze and
visualize drug interactions and implements a widely used method for
assessing drug interactions: *the Bliss independence model*.

  

## 📐 **Bliss independence model**

The Bliss independence model is a mathematical framework used to
evaluate the independence (ie. the absence of any interaction effect) of
two drugs when they are administered in combination. The general form of
Bliss independence model is the following equation:

$$E_{combined} = E_{A} + E_{B} - \left( E_{A} \cdot E_{B} \right)$$
where:

- $E_{A}$ is the effect of drug A,
- $E_{B}$ is the effect of drug B,
- $E_{combined}$ is the expected effect of the drug combination.

In the case of a cancer cell population, the effect will correspond to
the fraction of cells killed by the drug(s). For example, if drug A
kills 30% of the cells, $E_{A} = 0.3$ and drug B kills 40% of the cells
$E_{B} = 0.4$. According to the Bliss independence model, the expected
effect of the combination of drugs A and B would be:
$$E_{combined} = 0.3 + 0.4 - (0.3 \times 0.4) = 0.58$$ This means that
the combination of drugs A and B is expected to kill 58% of the cells if
they act independently.

The Bliss equation can be recast in terms of unaffected cells as
follows:

$$U_{combined} = U_{A} \cdot U_{B}$$

where:

- $U_{A}$ is the fraction of unaffected cells by drug A (ie. viability
  after treatment with drug A),
- $U_{B}$ is the fraction of unaffected cells by drug B (ie. viability
  after treatment with drug B),
- $U_{combined}$ is the expected fraction of unaffected cells by the
  drug combination.

For example, if drug A leaves 70% of the cells unaffected, $U_{A} = 0.7$
and drug B leaves 60% of the cells unaffected $U_{B} = 0.6$. According
to the Bliss independence model, the expected fraction of unaffected
cells by the combination of drugs A and B would be:

$$U_{combined} = 0.7 \times 0.6 = 0.42$$ This means that the combination
of drugs A and B is expected to leave 42% of the cells unaffected if
they act independently.

The generalized form of the Bliss equation for a combination of n drugs
is:

$$U_{combined} = \prod\limits_{i = 1}^{n}U_{i}$$

where:

- $i = 1,...,n$ indexes the drugs in the combination,
- $U_{i}$ is the fraction of unaffected cells by drug $i$.

🚨 **Important**: The values in the input matrix must correspond to the
percentage of living cells.

  

## 👀 ️**Visual example**

To illustrate the Bliss independence model, consider the following
example with two drugs, A and B:

## 🔍 **Evaluation of drug interactions**

To evaluate the interaction between drugs, the observed effect of the
drug combination is compared to the expected effect calculated using the
Bliss independence model. This is simply done by subtracting the
observed effect from the expected effect:

$$Interaction = U_{expected} - U_{observed}$$

  

## 🧩 **Interpretation**:

The interaction can be classified into three categories based on this
comparison:

- ⚡ **Synergy**:More cells killed than expected → positive interaction
  effect ($U_{expected} - U_{observed}$)
- ⚖️ **Additivity**: As many cells killed as expected → no interaction
  effect ($U_{expected} \approx U_{observed}$)
- ⚔️ **Antagonism**: Less cells killed than expected → negative
  interaction effect ($U_{expected} > U_{observed}$)

  

## 👀 ️**Visual example**

## 🧮 **Quantification of drug interactions**

In addition to this point-bypoint estimation, different measures can be
used to quantify drug interactions. In the `EDITH` package, we implement
three different indexes: the additive index, the combination index and
the efficacy index.

🚨 **Important**: These indexes can be used **if and only if** the
dilution factor is fixed between all the dose levels for each drug used
in the cytotocixity assay.

🚨 **Important**: These indexes can be used to compared different
experiments **if and only if** the same drug concentration ranges and
the same dilution factors are used in all experiments.

  

### 🌟 **Combination index**

According to the approach proposed by Lehár (Lehár et al., 2007, 2008,
2009), the **combination index**, is calculated as follows:

$$CI = \ln f_{A} \cdot \ln f_{B} \cdot \sum\limits_{A,B}\left( U_{expected} - U_{observed} \right)$$

where:

- $f_{A}$ and $f_{B}$ are the dilution factors used in the cytotocixity
  assay for drugs A and B respectively,
- $U_{observed}$ and $U_{expected}$ are the matrices of the survival
  percentage for the experimental data and for the corresponding Bliss
  independence data, respectively.

The generalized form of the equation for a combination of $n$ drugs is:

$$CI = \prod\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\ln f_{i} \cdot \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\left( U_{expected} - U_{observed} \right)_{i}$$

where:

- $f_{i}$ is the dilution factor used in the cytotoxicity assay for drug
  $i$,
- $U_{observed}$ and $U_{expected}$ are the matrices of the survival
  percentage for the experimental data and for the corresponding Bliss
  independence data, respectively.

🧩 **Interpretation**: The higher the combination index, the more
synergistic the drugs are.

  

### 🌟 **Efficacy index**

An **efficacy index** is calculated as follow:

$$EI = \ln f_{A} \cdot \ln f_{B} \cdot \sum\limits_{A,B}\left( 100 - U_{observed} \right)$$

where:

- $f_{A}$ and $f_{B}$ are the dilution factors used in the cytotocixity
  assay for drugs A and B respectively,
- $U_{observed}$ is the matrix of the survival percentage for the
  experimental data.

The generalized form of the equation for a combination of $n$ drugs is:

$$EI = \prod\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\ln f_{i} \cdot \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\left( 100 - U_{observed} \right)_{i}$$

where:

- $f_{i}$ is the dilution factor used in the cytotoxicity assay for drug
  $i$,
- $U_{observed}$ is the matrix of the survival percentage for the
  experimental data.

🧩 **Interpretation**: The higher the efficacy index, the more lethal
the drugs are.

  

### 🌟 **Additivity index**

An **additive index** is calculated as follow:

$$AI = \ln f_{A} \cdot \ln f_{B} \cdot \sum\limits_{A,B}\left( 100 - U_{expected} \right)$$

where:

- $f_{A}$ and $f_{B}$ are the dilution factors used in the cytotocixity
  assay for drugs A and B respectively,
- $U_{expected}$ is the matrix of the survival percentage for the
  corresponding Bliss independence data.

The generalized form of the equation for a combination of $n$ drugs is:

$$AI = \prod\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\ln f_{i} \cdot \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n}\left( 100 - U_{expected} \right)_{i}$$

where:

- $f_{i}$ is the dilution factor used in the cytotoxicity assay for drug
  $i$,
- $U_{expected}$ is the matrix of the survival percentage for the
  corresponding Bliss independence data.

🧩 **Interpretation**: The higher the combination index, the more lethal
the drugs are supposed to be according to the Bliss independance model.
